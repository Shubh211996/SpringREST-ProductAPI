In this project, we're creating a RESTful API using Spring Boot to manage product information for an inventory system. This API supports basic Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations, allowing us to manage product data efficiently.
For storing the data, we're using a MySQL database, which is a widely-used, reliable relational database. This allows us to persist the data permanently so it can be accessed, updated, and managed across different sessions.
The project revolves around a Product entity, which stores details like the product's name, description, brand, price, category, release date, availability, and quantity. To handle database operations such as saving, retrieving, and updating products, we're leveraging Spring Data JPA. This framework simplifies interactions with the database by providing built-in methods for common operations, so we don't have to write complex SQL queries manually.

Each of the CRUD operations is exposed through a REST API:

GET requests allow us to retrieve either all products or a specific product by its ID.
POST requests are used to add a new product to the system.
PUT requests allow updating an existing product's details.
DELETE requests remove a product from the database.

For communication between the frontend and backend, we're making the API available at http://localhost:8181, ensuring that requests from different front-end technologies like React or Angular can easily interact with the backend.

To interact with the MySQL database, you'll need to configure the connection properties in the application.properties file:

Database URL: jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/your_database_name
Username: your_mysql_username
Password: your_mysql_password
Once the data is stored, it can be retrieved, modified, or deleted based on the business requirements. This makes it easy to maintain a dynamic inventory system where products and their details are frequently updated.

The combination of Spring Boot, MySQL, and JPA provides a robust foundation for building scalable, maintainable, and efficient backend systems. Once the backend is set up, it can be connected to a frontend application using Axios or other HTTP clients for seamless user interaction.
